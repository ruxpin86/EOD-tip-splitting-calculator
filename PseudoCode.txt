Payout Rules: 
    + This is for one single shift, no multi-shift logic yet (maybe ability to store results though later on).
    + Tips are distributed proportionally by the amount of hours worked for the shift. 
    + Decimal hours are allowed
    + Payouts are rounded to the nearest cent (but typically there will be no change involved)
    + Any remaining cents leftover after rounding are distributed starting with the employee who worked the most hours OR support staff (decide later)
    + Invalid input = negative hours, missing name = rejected with a message to correct

Input:
    - Total amount of tips
    - Employees names
    - Number of hours each employee worked for the shift

Output:
    - Total tips made / Total hours on the tip pool = tips per hour
    - Name : total hours worked * tips $ per hour amount = total $ amount of payout
