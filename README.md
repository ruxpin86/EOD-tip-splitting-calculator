Abstract: At the end of the night behind the bar we are always very tired and exhausted form an intense evening of helping guests and making drinks. Add on top of that cleaning and making sure the bar is put back in order for the next day, counting out tips with after having a shot or two can get a bit tedious and sometimes sloppy. This app aims to simplify the process of calculating the disbursement of tips at the end of a shift, and create a log that keeps track of who, and how much everyone got paid so there are no questions of equity or fairness.
